# BIQU-B2

## Use at your own risk I have only tested it on my own printer

## Same as the main branch but for the SKR 1.4 board


This is currently the firmware I use for the BIQU B1 with the B2 (2 in 1 hotend) with an SKR1.4 Board and TMC2225(2208) drivers BLtouch Homing disabled. Driver jumpers need to be placed in UART mode. 
[Reference image for UART mode.](https://github.com/Apexpredation/BIQU-B2/blob/9b9021f619ca5781a41008cb943e74a28306bcdb/Reference%20Images/SKR2%20UART%20Mode.jpg)


 
 This one is not set up with BLtouch for homming, but bltouch is still active for later use.
