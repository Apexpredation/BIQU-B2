# BIQU-B2

## Use at your own risk I have only tested it on my own printer

This is currently the firmware I use for the BIQU B1 with the B2 (2 in 1 hotend) with an SKR2 Board and TMC2225(2208) drivers and BLtouch. Driver jumpers need to be placed in UART mode. 
[Reference image for UART mode.](https://github.com/Apexpredation/BIQU-B2/blob/9b9021f619ca5781a41008cb943e74a28306bcdb/Reference%20Images/SKR2%20UART%20Mode.jpg)

 ## Don't use if you don't have a BLtouch installed
 
 It is set up with BLtouch for homming
 
     * Double check and Set up yor own Probe offsets
     * Z-endstop switch should be diabled/removed to prevent damage
