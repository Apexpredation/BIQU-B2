# BIQU-B2

This is currently the firmware I use for the BIQU B1 with the B2 (2 in 1 hotend) with an SKR2 Board and TMC2225(2208) drivers and BLtouch. Driver jumpers need to be placed in UART mode.

 ## Don't use if you don't have a BLtouch installed
 
 It is set up with BLtouch for homming
 **Double check and Set up yor own Probe offsets**
