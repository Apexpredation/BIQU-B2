# Configuration files for Prusa Slicer

## To import, go to File - Import - Import config

## new users, I recommend the bundle version. It should set things up for a fresh build and save things to be used again. The regular config file will just bring in the settings to an existing setup, but you will have to save the changes to use it again.
